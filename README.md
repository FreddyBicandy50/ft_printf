## Project Idea
This project is pretty straightforward, you have to recode printf. You will learn what is and how to implement variadic functions. Once you validate it, you will reuse this function in your future projects.

## Usage
``make`` to compile mandatory part.

## Guides

The most interesting part of any project is the research that goes behind it. If you are a student, please don't miss out on that opportunity by simply following guides such as these. In any case, they should under no circumstances be your only source of information about this project. Try things, fail, research, try again and succeed! And maybe write your own guide about it. Writing really is the best way to learn.
